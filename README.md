# PONY New York

We make walking in NYC safer. You can request a protector to accompany you to walk to your desired destination, or you can be a protector to accompany people in need.

- You as a walker can request for a protetor by submitting the form with these information: meetup location, destination, and whether it's a current request or a fututure request. If it's a future request, then you need to specify the date and time. 
- After submitting the form, a message "Waiting for a protector..." shows up, and you will be navigated to another page where you can see the trip's map and directions when a protector accepts your request.

- Once you're logged in as a protector, you will see all the future and current requests on this page.
- If you accept a future request, the request will be in your scheduled walks page.
- If you accept a current request, you will be taken to a page where you will see the details of the trip.
